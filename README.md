# 🚀 Web Gen: Develop Website by AI
### **Gemini 3 Global Hackathon Submission**
**Developed by Luminous Organisation**



Web Gen is an agentic web-authoring IDE designed for the "Vibe Coding" era. It leverages the cutting-edge reasoning capabilities of **Gemini 3 Flash** to transform natural language descriptions into fully functional, production-ready, self-contained web applications.

## 🧠 The Gemini 3 Integration
Web Gen is built to showcase the specific 2026 features of the Gemini 3 ecosystem.

* **Agentic Reasoning:** We utilize the `thinking_level: HIGH` parameter. This forces the model to reason through DOM hierarchy and CSS layout logic before generating code, drastically reducing syntax errors.
* **High-Context Memory:** Leveraging Gemini 3’s **1M+ context window**, Web Gen stores the entire project history, allowing for iterative design (e.g., "Now add a contact form that matches the header's style") with perfect architectural consistency.
* **Low-Latency Synthesis:** By optimizing our calls for **Gemini 3 Flash**, we achieve near-instantaneous code generation, keeping the developer in a "flow state."

## ✨ Key Features
* **Description-to-Deployment:** Generate HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript in a single, portable file.
* **Self-Contained Ecosystems:** Ideal for landing pages, dashboards, Canvas-based games, and responsive UI components.
* **Integrated Mobile Preview:** Render and test code immediately within the built-in Android WebView.
* **Auto-Persistence:** Your prompts and generated code are automatically saved to your local library.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
Web Gen is built using a modern Android stack designed for high-performance AI interactions.

1.  **UI Layer:** Native Android (Kotlin) providing a clean, distraction-free IDE experience.
2.  **Logic Layer:** A structured prompt-engine that wraps user "vibes" into architecturally sound system instructions.
3.  **AI Engine:** **Google Gemini 3 Flash API** via Google AI Studio.
4.  **Rendering:** High-performance WebView for real-time sandboxed execution of generated code.
